# What I`ve done?

Project wac created by newest Angular CLI.
I mainy focused on working functionality due to 4 hours limit.
Every function is covered by unit test and these tests are green.

# UI Framework
I used Angular Material 
To be honest there is still a lot to do in the visual field. I only implemented the basic versions of responsiveness and general appearance.
